= Introduction =

This document contains all the information about the prototype for karts.


= Game Modes =

Available modes for the prototype:

== Single Player ==
    The player can explore the circuit or try to improve his times. 

== Multiplayer ==
    The player can choose to create a game or join an existing one. 


= Characters/Vehicles =

The players will be able to select between a few pre-made vehicle/character combinations. These will be based in the characteristics used for the races (driving/items):
 * Speed
 * Acceleration
 * Weight: Used for collisions between karts. It can also be used for jumps. 
 * Grip: The ease or difficulty to drive the kart. 
 * Luck: Used to collect better items.

= Circuits =

There will be a single circuit in this prototype. It will have a main way, limited by some barriers, many "?" boxes for the items, the starting grid and at least one shotcut. Optionally we can add jumps and boosts. The circuit will be plain, with no ramps (appart from those that can make the karts jump).
